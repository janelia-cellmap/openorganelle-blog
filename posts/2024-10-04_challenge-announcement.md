The [CellMap Project Team](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/cellmap) is excited to announce the upcoming CellMap Segmentation Challenge, launching towards the end of October! This unique competition invites participants to test their skills in the high-resolution segmentation of organelles from a diverse selection of vEM microscopy datasets.

The challenge will feature nearly 300 meticulously annotated training crops from more than 20 eFIB-SEM datasets, covering over 40 unique organelle classes. These annotations have been expertly curated to support cutting-edge machine learning approaches in biological image analysis.
