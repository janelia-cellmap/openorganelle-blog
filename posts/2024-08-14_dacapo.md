We're excited to announce the release of **DaCapo**, a software framework developed to enhance 3D image segmentation workflows. DaCapo is an open-source tool that allows researchers to create, train, and evaluate machine learning models with greater efficiency and flexibility, particularly in the context of FIB-SEM datasets and similar high-resolution, large imaging data.

### Why DaCapo?

Machine learning has become an indispensable tool in biomedical research, enabling the automated analysis of complex imaging datasets. However, setting up and managing these workflows can often be cumbersome and time-consuming. DaCapo addresses these challenges by providing a user-friendly, modular framework that integrates seamlessly with existing tools and data formats.

### Key Features

- **Modular Design:** DaCapo is built with flexibility in mind, allowing researchers to easily customize and extend the framework to suit their specific needs. The modular architecture ensures that each component can be independently modified or upgraded without disrupting the overall workflow.
- **Compatibility with Popular Tools:** DaCapo integrates smoothly with widely used tools in the biomedical imaging community, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others. This ensures that researchers can leverage their existing expertise and resources without needing to learn new systems from scratch.
- **Comprehensive Documentation and Support:** The [CellMap Project Team](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/cellmap), together with the [Funke Lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/funke-lab), has worked to provide thorough documentation, tutorials, and community support to help users get the most out of the software.

### Recent Publication

In a recent [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02834) on arXiv, the development team details the underlying architecture of DaCapo and presents case studies demonstrating its effectiveness in processing large-scale FIB-SEM datasets. The paper outlines how DaCapoâ€™s design principles contribute to both its ease of use and its adaptability to different research scenarios.

### Get Started with DaCapo
