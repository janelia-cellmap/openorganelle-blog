Imagine your skin is like a big, soft, and flexible sheet covering your whole body. Touch end organs are like little sensors embedded in this sheet. These sensors help you feel things when you touch them.

There are different types of touch end organs, each specialized for different things. Some are really good at sensing pressure, like when you press your finger on a table. Others are more sensitive to temperature, like when you feel something hot or cold. Some can even detect pain.

These sensors send messages to your brain when they sense something, and your brain interprets these messages to help you understand what you're touching or feeling. So, touch end organs are like the messengers that help your brain understand the world through the sense of touch.

In a recent publication<sup>1</sup>, the [Ginty Lab](https://www.gintylab.hms.harvard.edu) at Harvard Medical School discusses how our skin sensors, called mechanosensory end organs, respond to light touches. They focused on three types of these sensors and found that a protein called Piezo2 is located on the nerve fibers connected to these sensors. When we touch something, the stretching of nerve fiber extensions activates Piezo2, helping us feel the touch. This study sheds light on how these sensors work during gentle touches.
