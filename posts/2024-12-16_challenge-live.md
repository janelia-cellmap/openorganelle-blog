The [CellMap Project Team](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/cellmap) is thrilled to announce that the **CellMap Segmentation Challenge is officially LIVE!** This is your opportunity to push the boundaries of AI-driven biological image analysis by developing segmentation models for a richly detailed collection of electron microscopy datasets.

### The Challenge  

The CellMap Segmentation Challenge features **289 meticulously annotated training volumes** drawn from **22 eFIB-SEM datasets**, spanning over **40 unique organelle classes.** Each dataset has been expertly annotated and reviewed by multiple annotators to ensure high-quality ground truth data.  

This diverse collection includes cell culture and tissue samples from organisms such as mouse, *Drosophila*, zebrafish, and human, covering vital biological regions like the brain, heart, liver, and kidney. The datasets were captured at ultra-high resolutions (4 nm or 8 nm isotropic voxel sizes), using advanced **Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (eFIB-SEM)** and various preservation methods, including chemical fixation and high-pressure freezing.

With such a robust dataset, the challenge is designed to encourage innovative segmentation approaches that generalize well across different biological contexts and imaging conditions.
