John Bogovic (Saalfeld Lab) and Aubrey Weigel (CellMap Project Team) traveled to Ventura, CA this summer for the [2023 Volume Electron Microscopy (vEM) Gordan Research Conference](https://www.grc.org/volume-electron-microscopy-conference/2023/). This very first GRC on vEM. It brought together an amazing community *in person* to exchange ideas, discuss the latest developments in the field, and stimulate new collaborations. It was and exciting and fulfilling conference and we're all excited for many more to come.

John took part as a poster judge for trainees. Check out the winners of this year's poster presentations below:

Aubrey chaired the session on "Visualising and Sharing Big vEM Data" in which key methods and technologies 
for volume EM data were presented and discussed. These included the [BioImage archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/),
[BigDataViewer](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3392), [OME-Zarr](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9980008/), and
[Empanada](https://volume-em.github.io/empanada.html). 

John presented a talk titled "Toward Accessible, Scalable, and Interoperable Image Registration with BigWarp", describing 
new developments in [BigWarp](https://imagej.net/plugins/bigwarp), and how scientists at Janelia and in CellMap have used it
to solve their registration problems.

Not only were new collaborations and friendships made, but the conference was also an excellent opportunity to meet collaborators in person for the first time! John has worked with Norman Rzepka ([scalable minds](https://scalableminds.com)) and Josh Moore ([GerBI-GMB](https://gerbi-gmb.de)) fairly extensively. They've even written a paper together<sup>1</sup> but only interacted virtually to date. The group took advantage of the beautiful California scenery during the breaks and even went surfing.
